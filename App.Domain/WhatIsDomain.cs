         * The domain and application layer are always the center of the design and are known as the core of the system.
         * The domain layer in the clean architecture contains the enterprise logic, like the entities and their specifications. 
         * This layer lies in the center of the architecture where we have application entities, 
         * which are the application model classes or database model classes, 
         * using the code first approach in the application development using Asp.net core these entities are used to create the tables in the database.
